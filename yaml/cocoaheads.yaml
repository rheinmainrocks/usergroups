  CocoaHeads is a group devoted to discussion of Apple Computer's Cocoa Framework for programming on
  MacOS X (including the iPhone). During monthly meetings, members present on their projects and offer tutorials
  on various programming topics. We meet each 1st Monday. We usually have one presentation and some discussions
  and then go for beers.
