description: |
  For all who are fascinated by the Haskell Programming Language and want to exchange ideas, knowledge,
  experience. Of course this includes academia, programmers in industry, hobbyists ... It also includes
  discussions about FP in general and topics of other FP languages - for example Clojure, Scala, F#, OCaml - are
  welcome. Focus of course is Haskell (therefore the name). It is fun meeting face to face, so instead reading and
  writing more listening and talking!
