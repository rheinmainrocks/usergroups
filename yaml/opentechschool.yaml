  The RheinMain area is a huge area around Frankfurt where many web technology startups
  have their
  headquarters. Anyone coming from the area is welcomed to join OTS RheinMain! We want to connect the developers,
  designers and curious people in that area and share knowledge and expertise with them.

  **About OpenTechSchool**

  OpenTechSchool is a community initiative offering free programming workshops and meetups to technology
  enthusiasts of all genders, backgrounds, and experience levels. It supports volunteer coaches in setting up
  events by taking care of the organizational details, encouraging coaches to create original teaching material.
  This material is then openly shared online and can be further developed by contributions from the global OTS
  community. OTSâ€™ main goal is to create a friendly learning environment where no one feels shy about asking any
  question. Everyone is invited to participate, whether as a coach or a learner, and get in contact to organize
  OTS events anywhere in the world.
