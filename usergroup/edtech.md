![EdTech Rhein-Main](./edtech.logo.png)

This group is for all people who are interested in education and #EdTech (education
        technology)
        especially. And it is all about networking and discussing trends and ideas in this vibrant and fast evolving
        field of education. At the same time this meetup is meant to be the hub for all educational start-ups in the
        Rhein-Main area working on the next big thing in education! And yes, the goal is to bring you all (teachers,
        entrepreneurs, politicians, parents, students, ...) together, all at one table! And never forget
        [#RheinMainRocks](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RheinMainRocks) - Be part of it!
