# Micropreneurs am Main (Frankfurt)
![Micropreneurs am Main (Frankfurt)](./micropreneurs.logo.png)

I’m a budding micropreneur striving to earn a living by selling products I created. I am currently launching a one-man product (http://gemba.io) with no aspirations of getting investor funding or growing this into a full-fledged company.

I’d like to share with like-minded folks the joy, the hardships and the lessons learned in building a one-man business. So let’s meet up regularly over dinner or beers and learn from each other!
